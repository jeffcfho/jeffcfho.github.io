## About me

I am an environmental researcher-turned data scientist. I was most recently an [Insight Data Science Fellow](https://insightfellows.com/data-science){:target="_blank"} in New York. 

Formerly, I was the Director of Science and Product at [Cloud to Street](https://www.cloudtostreet.info/){:target="_blank"}, where I managed the deployment of a disaster monitoring platform enabling access to impact analytics for the worldâ€™s most climate-vulnerable communities. 

Prior to that, I received my PhD and MS in Civil & Environmental Engineering from Stanford University, where my research on satellite remote sensing of water quality and water access monitoring in resource-constrained settings was described in numerous [academic publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=lLgELn4AAAAJ){:target="_blank"} and featured in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/03/science/earth/lake-erie.html){:target="_blank"}, [Gizmodo](https://earther.gizmodo.com/toxic-algae-blooms-really-have-become-more-intense-stu-1839039124){:target="_blank"}, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/10/09/lake-eries-unnatural-transformation-turned-it-an-eerie-bright-green){:target="_blank"}, and [elsewhere](press/). I am a former [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp){:target="_blank"} Doctoral scholar and Woods Institute [Rising Environmental Leaders Fellow](https://woods.stanford.edu/educating-leaders/education-leadership-programs/rising-environmental-leaders-program){:target="_blank"}.
